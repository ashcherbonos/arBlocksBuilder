# AR Blocks Builder

The AR Blocks Builder application allows you to construct 3D objects with voxels using Augmented Reality technology.

Place your models anywhere: in your apartment, on the street, in a cafe or in the forest. And, maybe you'd like to add voxel graphics to popular places and tourists sights?

You can choose any color, draw objects of any shape you want as long as it’s cube :)

You can view constructed object from all sides, save it to your phone, move to another location and share it with your friends.

Also you can go into the fairy castle you’ve built!

AR Blocks Builder is suitable for adults and children of different ages.

There are no restrictions, full freedom of creativity! Build grand buildings, futuristic machines, funny animals or amazing abstractions. It's time to make this world brighter!

# notes

This is my very old project. I made it just to have some fun with augmented reality. It has ugly architecture but has some interesting solutions, like on-fly mesh generation, instead of just instantiate more cubes (which will kill your performance very quickly in an app like this)
